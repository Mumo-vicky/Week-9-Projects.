# Projects Description

These projects done are on kNN Classifier and the Naive Bayes Classifier. The kNN Classifier is used on the titanic dataset while the Naive Bayes Classifier is used on the spam dataset

## kNN (k Nearest Neighbour) Classifier

As said earlier, this classifier is used for the titanic dataset. It will be used to determine the likelihood of a person either surviving or not. There are many factors that are to be put into consideration, among them the age, the class and also the cabin among others. All these have a probability of contributing to whether one survives or not. The classifier will undergo various techniques in order for its improvement.

## Naives Bayes Classifier

This classifier is to be used in the spam dataset. It will be used in the determinance of spam messages. This will be based on several characteristics, among them; capitalization of letters, the presence of several characters, the frequency of certain words and others. The classifier will undergo optimization and the perfomance of the same will be compared.

# Technologies Used
Google Colabs, Python Libraries and Github.

# Usage
The prjects are going to show the usages of the k-NN Classifier and the Naive Bayes Classifier and their application to real world issues.
